{"name":"Twitch-multi-live-streaming","tagline":"View multiple twitch streams at once.","body":"### Welcome.\r\nThis project is a very easy to use viewer for multiple live streams simultaneously. The viewer embeds the HTML5 Twitch stream or streams of the user(s) you wish to view.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n1. Open (./index.php) in your favorite text editor and find the lines below:\r\n`//modify this -- put whatever Twitch usernames you want here.\r\n  $channels=\"cryancaire,huevos74,sobuto,chuckdatruc7\";`\r\n2. Adjust the value of $channels to the desired twitch username(s).\r\n3. Upload both of the files (./index.php, ./setup.php) a directory on your server.\r\n4. Once uploaded, navigate to index.php (http://yourdomain.com/livestream/index.php) and you will see the stream(s) and chat window(s) of your desired twitch user(s).\r\n\r\n## Advanced Setup\r\nYou can use (./setup.php) to customize the streams and sizes of those streams on a one-time (or more if you save the link) basis.\r\n1. Navigate to setup.php (http://yourdomain.com/livestream/setup.php)\r\n2. Enter the name(s) of the twitch stream(s) you wish to view. (Comma separate for more than one.)\r\n3. Navigate to the generated link. (Your browser should automatically open to the generated link.)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
